# Data-Science-CVE-Final

**Purpose:** In recent years, cybersecurity has become an increasingly important issue, with organizations of all sizes being targeted by various forms of cyber attacks. To better understand the nature and scope of these attacks and their current trends, it is essential to analyze data related to vulnerabilities in software and systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database is one such resource that provides a wealth of information on vulnerabilities. In this project, the aim is to analyze CVE data using Python to gain insights into the types of vulnerabilities that exist, the severity of these vulnerabilities, the frequency with which they are reported, the severity of such vulnerabilities, and cyber vulnerability trends. We will use various Python libraries and tools to manipulate and visualize the data, allowing us to better understand and communicate our findings, including pandas data frames and matplotlib pyplots.
